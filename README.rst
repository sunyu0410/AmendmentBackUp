Motivations
-----------

When it comes to backing up a large amoumt of data, it is often
preferable to only copy the modified and new files, rather than simply
coping the whole directory. The ``AmendmentBackUp`` (``ABU``) class
provides a simple interface to do that. No dependencies are required
apart from the Python 3 standard library.

The design
----------

Say we have two folders, a source folder ``dir1`` which you have your
most recent files and a reference folder ``dir2`` which holds some of
your previous backup. What the ``ABU`` does is to compare all files in
``dir1`` with those in ``dir2``, and copy the files to a third
destination folder ``dst``.

A quick example
---------------

.. code:: python

    from AmendmentBackUp import *
    createDemo()
    abu = AmendmentBackUp(dir1=r"demo/dir1",
                          dir2=r"demo/dir2",
                          dst=r"demo/dst")
    abu.compare()
    abu.backup()

Explanations
------------

Say you have the ``dir1`` and ``dir2`` (along with a ``dst`` to copy the
files to) with the following tree structures:

::

            dir1 (source, recently updated)
            |   file1.txt
            |   file2.txt (modified)
            |   file3.txt (new)
            |   
            +---subfolder1
            |       file4.txt
            |       
            +---subfolder2
            |       file5.txt
            |       file6.txt (modified)
            |       
            \---subfolder3 (new)
                    anyfile.txt
                    
            dir2 (reference, e.g. a previous backup)
            |   file1.txt
            |   file2.txt
            |   file7.txt
            |   
            +---subfolder1
            |       file4.txt
            |       
            \---subfolder2
                    file5.txt
                    file6.txt
                    
            dst (destination)
            

In this case, we want to copy the modified and new file(s) in ``dir1``:

::

    file2.txt
    file3.txt
    subfolder2/file6.txt

and new folder(s):

::

    subfolder3

You can initiate an ``ABU`` object by calling

.. code:: python

    abu = AmendmentBackUp(dir1=r'path_to/dir1', 
                          dir2=r'path_to/dir2', 
                          dst=r'path_to/dst')

By the way, the ``createDemo()`` will create a demo folder with
structures shown above. After initiation, call the following ``ABU``
methods to proceed:

-  ``abu.compare()``: Compare files by walking through all files and
   folders in ``dir1`` and check the existence of the corresponding
   counterparts in ``dir2``.

   -  If negative, it then adds the file or folder to the copy list;

   -  If positive, it compares two corresponding files (from ``dir1``
      and ``dir2`` respectively, shallow comparison using the time stamp
      and the file size);

      -  If two files don't match, it will add the file to the copy
         list;

      -  Otherwise, it will continue to the next one.

-  ``abu.backup()``: Copy the files and folders in the copy list.

   -  Folders will be copied first. If the parent folder has been
      copied, any child folder will be skipped;

   -  Files will copied next. If the file falls under any folder copied
      in the previous step, it will be skipped.

-  The metadata of the backup process will be stored in a folder called
   ``_abu`` with a time stamp (year-month-day-hour-minute-second) in the
   ``dst`` folder. These include

::


        - abu_log.txt      Log file
        - abu_obj.pickle   ABU object of this backup task
        - dir1_tree.txt    Tree structure of dir1 (source)
        - dir2_tree.txt    Tree structure of dir2 (reference)
        - dst_tree.txt     Tree structure of dst (destination)

Results
-------

Here is the tree structure of ``dst`` after the backup:

::

            dst
            |   file2.txt
            |   file3.txt
            |
            +---subfolder2
            |       file6.txt
            |
            +---subfolder3
            |       anyfile.txt
            |
            \---_abu_20190717101307
                    abu_log.txt
                    abu_obj.pickle
                    dir1_tree.txt
                    dir2_tree.txt
                    dst_tree.txt

If you want to add the files to the previous back ``dir2``, you can
simply set ``dst`` to ``dir2``.

Limitations
-----------

The ``ABU`` is best suited when the source folder ``dir1`` is a natural
growth of the reference folder ``dir2``. What *natural growth* means is
that there should not be too much renaming or move of the subfolders
from ``dir2`` to ``dir1``. Otherwise, using a version control system is
probably a better option since ``ABU`` won't track the history of any
folder or file.
